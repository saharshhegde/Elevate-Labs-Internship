Header Analysis — Task 2

1) Received lines:
- Earliest hop: 203.113.23.55 (unknown123.isp.vn) — not a PayPal sending IP.
- Mail was injected via an external ISP and relayed to mx.example.local.

2) From / Reply-To / Return-Path:
- From: security-alert@paypa1-support.com (domain paypa1-support.com — suspicious because of “1”)
- Reply-To: no-reply@securelogin.cn (different domain -> receiver replies to attacker)
- Return-Path: bounce@securelogin.cn

3) Flags to check with tool:
- SPF: Does senders' domain have SPF and does the sending IP pass?
- DKIM: Is message signed and does signature verify?
- DMARC: Is the domain protected by DMARC?

Recommendations:
- Paste the full headers into an online header analyzer (MXToolbox / Google Toolbox) for SPF/DKIM/DMARC results.
