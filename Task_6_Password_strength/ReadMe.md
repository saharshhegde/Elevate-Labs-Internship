\# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength



\*\*Objective:\*\* Understand password strength factors and test multiple passwords against online password strength tools.



\## Steps Performed

1\. Created multiple passwords with different lengths and complexities.

2\. Included variations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3\. Tested each password using \[passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/).
